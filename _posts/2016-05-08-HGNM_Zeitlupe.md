## HGNM Zietlupe:

_pale glimmering trails_, my new work for the [Asian Art Ensemble](http://www.asianart-ensemble.com/german/Startseite.html), was presented as part of the [HGNM Zeitlupe](https://www.facebook.com/events/1717527895127803/) concert series at the Sprengel Museum, Hannover.  [Il-Ryun Chung](http://www.ilryunchung.com/de/Anfang.html), artistic director of the ensemble, led a discussion about my work on this new piece.  Thanks to the [Ernst von Siemens Music Foundation](http://www.evs-musikstiftung.ch/en/index.html) for supporting the commission of this piece!
