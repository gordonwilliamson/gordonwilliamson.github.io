Welcome to my new website!  After a few years of relative stasis, this will hopefully be a better platform for you to peruse my work and current projects.  The basic elements are now in place and more is coming soon, including links to recordings in Soundcloud, better access to my scores and further information about my teaching activities.  So please do check back in often!
