## Styria Artist-in-Residency Program

From November 2105 to January 2016 I've had an artist residency in Graz, Austra, as a guest of the Ministry of Culture in Styria.  I've been working at the [Schaumbad](http://web455.webbox333.server-home.org/) in town and am giving an artist's talk there on January 31 (more info [here](http://web455.webbox333.server-home.org/index.php?pageid=3&l=1&sid=255)).  Members of the [Schallfeld Ensemble](http://www.schallfeldensemble.com/) will be performing my work Domestic Abuse, and Margarethe Maierhofer-Lischka is moderating a discussion about my work!
