From November 2105 to January 2016 I've been a guest of the Styria Artist-in-Residency Program in Graz, Austra (Ministry of Culture in Styria).  I've been working at the [Schaumbad](http://web455.webbox333.server-home.org/) in town and am giving an artist's talk there on January 31 (more info [here](http://web455.webbox333.server-home.org/index.php?pageid=3&l=1&sid=255)).  Members of the [Schallfeld Ensemble](http://www.schallfeldensemble.com/) will be performing my piece Domestic Abuse, and Margarethe Maierhofer-Lischka is moderating a discussion about my work!
