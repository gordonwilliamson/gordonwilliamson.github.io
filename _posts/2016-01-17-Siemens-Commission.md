The [Asian Art Ensemble](http://www.asianart-ensemble.com/german/Startseite.html) has commissioned me to write a new piece for Koto, Gayageum, Cello and Double Bass, to be premiered on March 29th in the [Konzerthaus](http://en.konzerthaus.de/) in Berlin, Germany.  The commission has been made possible with the generous support of the [Ernst von Siemens Music Foundation](http://www.evs-musikstiftung.ch/en/index.html).
