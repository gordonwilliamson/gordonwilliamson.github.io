description: Seattle Premiere
---


Finally catching up on some web updates today... a few older news items to fill in and updated biography and contact info.  I'm also heading to Seattle, Washington soon for the premiere of my newest piece _In the Gold Room: a Harmony_.  The wonderful Esoterics, conducted by [Eric Banks](http://ericbanks.com/), are performing the choral piece three times on the weekend of October 7-9th.  Further info about exact locations on my performance page and at the [Esoterics](http://www.theesoterics.org/) website.  Hope to see you there!
